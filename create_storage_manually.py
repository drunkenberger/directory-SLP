SETTING UP SUPABASE STORAGE FOR BRAND IMAGES - MANUAL GUIDE
=======================================================

Since you're experiencing issues with the Python library for storage,
we'll guide you through the steps to set up storage manually in the 
Supabase dashboard:

1. Go to your Supabase dashboard: https://app.supabase.io/
2. Select your project
3. Click on "Storage" in the left sidebar
4. Click "Create new bucket"
5. Enter "brand-images" as the bucket name
6. Check "Public bucket" to make it publicly accessible
7. Click "Create bucket"

Once the bucket is created:

8. Click on the "brand-images" bucket 
9. Click "Upload file"
10. Upload a placeholder image (you can use any simple image)
11. Rename it to "placeholder.jpg"
12. Note the URL of the uploaded image (right-click â†’ Copy link)

After setting up storage:

13. Update the brand records in the database to use this URL
    - Replace "/images/placeholder.jpg" with the Supabase storage URL
    - The format will be something like:
      https://<supabase-project>.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/brand-images/placeholder.jpg

14. Make sure your frontend code is using the correct image URLs

=======================================================

This manual approach will ensure your brand images are properly stored in Supabase.
Once completed, you'll no longer see 404 errors for the missing image files.

Great! Now your Supabase storage is set up for brand images.

To update the frontend code, you'll need to:

1. Make sure the `getBrandById` and other functions in `src/lib/brands.ts` 
   are using the `image_url` field directly from Supabase.

2. Test your site to ensure images are loading correctly from Supabase storage.

If you have any issues, check the network tab in your browser's developer tools
to identify any 404 errors for images.
